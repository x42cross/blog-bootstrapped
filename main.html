		<h2> First Post </h2>
		<p id="First">
			Hello to anyone reading, this would just be the first of many blog post as I continue this rough journey into learning the never ending basics of how to code (and everything else happening in my life). I would like to say that after many years of blood, sweat and tears, I have learned many things. But, it feels like I'm always missing something, so each time I repeat the basics hoping for different results. They all end in tears. HOWEVER, this time will be different. It has to.

			Recently I noticed a post on reddit mentioning a very popular board game on sale on Amazon. The board game I saw was scythe, so I immediately did some research. What I found was that the setting is based in 1940 Europe and it hit all the right nodes for me. It has hextiles, resource management and combat. SO I was curious about how my friends would interact on a board game that is incredibly similar to Sid Myer's Civ. Short moments later the game was ordered and we played 2 games shortly after. At first some of the rules were confusing
